This repository contains the source code for a recipe archive website, a comprehensive collection of over 1000 recipes. The website is built using React and the extraction of recipes and their ingredients is powered by Python with a custom Natural Language Processing (NLP) model.

## Features

- **Recipes**: The website hosts an extensive collection of recipes, providing a rich resource for cooking enthusiasts and professionals alike.

- **Custom annotation tool**: Alongside the website there is a [custom annotation tool](https://github.com/joohei/annotator), designed and developed to annotate recipes and their ingredients. This tool was instrumental in generating the training data for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) model used in this project.

- **NLP Model**: The website utilizes a sophisticated NLP model that extracts ingredients from the recipes. This model was trained using the data generated by the custom annotation tool.

- **Sorting by Ingredients**: The website offers a unique feature that allows users to sort recipes based on their ingredients. This feature makes it easier for users to find recipes that utilize specific ingredients.

## Usage

This website is private and not available for public use. However, the source code is available for anyone to use and modify, without the recipe data.

## Development

The website was developed using React. The custom annotation tool was also developed using React. The NLP model was trained using Python and the spaCy library.
